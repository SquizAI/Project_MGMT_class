# Project Management Demo - Development & Deployment Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for finalizing development, setting up version control, and deploying the Project Management Demo application to Netlify. The plan ensures proper handling of environment variables, secrets, and continuous deployment.

## 1. Development Completion

### 1.1 Functionality Testing
- [ ] Test user authentication (registration, login, logout)
- [ ] Test project CRUD operations
- [ ] Test task CRUD operations
- [ ] Verify protected routes
- [ ] Test responsive design on different screen sizes

### 1.2 Code Cleanup
- [ ] Remove any console.log statements
- [ ] Ensure consistent code formatting
- [ ] Add comments for complex logic
- [ ] Update README.md with project information

## 2. Version Control Setup

### 2.1 Git Repository
- [ ] Initialize Git repository (if not already done)
- [ ] Create .gitignore file to exclude:
  - node_modules/
  - .env
  - .env.local
  - .env.development
  - .env.production
  - .DS_Store
  - build/
  - dist/
  - .netlify/
- [ ] Make initial commit with all source code

### 2.2 GitHub Repository
- [ ] Create new GitHub repository
- [ ] Connect local repository to GitHub
- [ ] Push initial commit to GitHub

## 3. Environment Variables Management

### 3.1 Local Development
- [ ] Create .env.example file with required variables (without actual values):
  ```
  VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
  VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
  ```
- [ ] Document environment variables in README.md

### 3.2 Production Environment
- [ ] Create separate .env.production file for production values
- [ ] Add .env.production to .gitignore

## 4. Netlify Deployment Setup

### 4.1 Netlify Configuration
- [ ] Update netlify.toml with build settings:
  ```toml
  [build]
    command = "npm run build"
    publish = "dist"
    
  [[redirects]]
    from = "/*"
    to = "/index.html"
    status = 200
  ```

### 4.2 Netlify Environment Variables
- [ ] Set up environment variables in Netlify dashboard:
  - VITE_SUPABASE_URL
  - VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

## 5. Continuous Deployment

### 5.1 Initial Deployment
- [ ] Create new site in Netlify
- [ ] Connect to GitHub repository
- [ ] Configure build settings
- [ ] Trigger initial deployment

### 5.2 Automated Deployments
- [ ] Set up branch-based deployments:
  - main branch → production
  - develop branch → staging/preview
- [ ] Configure deploy previews for pull requests

## 6. Post-Deployment

### 6.1 Testing
- [ ] Verify all functionality in production environment
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Test CRUD operations
- [ ] Check responsive design

### 6.2 Monitoring
- [ ] Set up error monitoring
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring
- [ ] Set up alerts for critical issues

## 7. Documentation

### 7.1 User Documentation
- [ ] Create user guide
- [ ] Document features and functionality

### 7.2 Developer Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with:
  - Project overview
  - Setup instructions
  - Environment variables
  - Deployment process
  - Contributing guidelines

## Timeline

1. Development Completion: 1-2 days
2. Version Control Setup: 1 day
3. Environment Variables Management: 1 day
4. Netlify Deployment Setup: 1 day
5. Continuous Deployment: 1 day
6. Post-Deployment: 1-2 days
